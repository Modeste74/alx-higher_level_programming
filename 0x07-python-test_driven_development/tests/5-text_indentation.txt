------------------------

``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` module:
	>>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

Checking for normal text indentation with a special charatcer at the end:
	>>> text_indentation("You are a bloody cow. But all the same we are still in this together. So we are going to need: salt, sugar, flour and? What else are we missing?")
	You are a bloody cow.
	<BLANKLINE>
	But all the same we are still in this together.
	<BLANKLINE>
	So we are going to need:
	<BLANKLINE>
	salt, sugar, flour and?
	<BLANKLINE>
	What else are we missing?
	<BLANKLINE>

Checking when nothing is passed:
	>>> text_indentation()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'

Checking when an int is passed:
	>>> text_indentation(45646737.373737838393939)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: text mmust be a string

	>>> text_indentation("    You, freeze.   I have a suspect    heading   south on queens.")
	You, freeze.
	<BLANKLINE>

	You, freeze.
	<BLANKLINE>
	I have a suspect    heading   south on queens
